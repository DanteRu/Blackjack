Blackjack

Casino blackjack simulator

Run play.php with php 5.3 or later.

If you want to test a different counting system or basic strategy, simple implement PlayerInterface.

Load up the player and run play.php


Known issues
=========
* The player can't see other players cards, I need to update the PlayerInterface so that it is called each time a card is shown.


Notes 
=========
This software has no user interface. If you don't know how PHP works, you probably won't be able to do anything useful with this software. If you do understand PHP, you might be able to do something mildly useful.
